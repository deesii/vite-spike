            <p>  I am Donna, switching from airport planning to software development,
            and looking for my first role in tech.</p>
            <p>From writing and updating HTML and CSS on my MySpace page, 
            playing around with VBA for creating user forms for data entry, to writing 
            Python to manipulate CSV files for data modelling and creating visuals in PowerBI, 
            I have always been fascinated with how we use technology to make our lives easier,
            how it alters our experiences and perceptions of products, and what 
            creative things we can do with the tech we make!</p>
            <p>
                I took the leap last year, studying cs50 Introduction to Computer Science, and 
                have just completed a Software Engineering Foundations bootcamp.  
            </p>
            <p>I am interested in people behaviours, patterns, and solving problems to make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>When I am not coding, I am reading, going on long hikes, doing something food-related, or keeping fit
            through badminton, netball, or running. I will finally run 10Km this year! 
            </p>
            <p>
            I would love to collaborate on a project and pair program to learn from eachother and have fun making things!
            </p>
